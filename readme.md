SlysCarts
==========

SlysCart is a Spigot Minecraft Server plugin for 1.14 and 1.15 (and hopefully 1.16 soon)

It makes 2 changes to minecart behavoir:
- When a player gets out of a minecart, it breaks the minecart.
- A moving minecart will maintain constant speed while on rails.

Powered rails are still useful/needed to allow minecarts to start and bounce.

The goal of these modifications is to make rail systems more accessible and less lag inducing with discarded carts.


SkylsCarts is part of my collection of mods with the following goals:
- Performant, Native-feeling
- Simple and easy to maintain
- Provide 1 feature effectively
